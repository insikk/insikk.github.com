I tried to open my blog for 3 years. To follow [hacker sprit](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude), I was finding place to share information about problem solving. Problem solving includes resolving problems which I encounter sometimes.

However I did not want to open my blog with blog providing services (e.g. wordpress, blogger). Because I am computer scientist, programmer and artist, I need to understand all procedure that involved in my blog, I need to take control all over my blog and I need to change my blog whatever I want. 

While those thought about blog were in my head, I found [GitHub](https://github.com) and [Octopress](octopress.org). And today, it is Sunday, which means I can spend my time for hobby. _Yes, it is Monday. I am being all-nighter today. Haha_ All resources are ready, and BOOM!!. I CREATED MY BLOG.

I hope my future postings provide useful information. So my readers can save their valuable time.

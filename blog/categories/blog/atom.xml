    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I tried to open my blog for 3 years. To follow <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude">hacker sprit</a>, I was finding place to share information about problem solving. Problem solving includes resolving problems which I encounter sometimes.</p>

<p>However I did not want to open my blog with blog providing services (eg. wordpress, blogger). Becuase I am computer scientist, programmer and artist, I need to understand all procedure that involved in my blog, I need to take control all over my blog and I need to change my blog whatever I want.</p>

<p>While those thought about blog were in my head, I found <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and <a href="octopress.org">Octopress</a>. And today, it is Sunday, wihch means I can spend my time for hobby. <em>Yes, it is Monday. I am being all-nighter today. Haha</em> All resources are ready, and BOOM!!. I CREATED MY BLOG.</p>

<p>I hope my future postings provide useful information. So my reader can save theire valuable time.</p>
